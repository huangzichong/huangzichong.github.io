        <h2 id="place_of_processing">Mode and place of processing the Data</h2>

        <h3>Methods of processing</h3>

        <p>The Owner takes appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or
            unauthorized destruction of the Data.<br>The Data processing is carried out using computers and/or IT
            enabled tools, following organizational procedures and modes strictly related to the purposes indicated. In
            addition to the Owner, in some cases, the Data may be accessible to certain types of persons in charge,
            involved with the operation of this Application (administration, sales, marketing, legal, system
            administration) or external parties (such as third-party technical service providers, mail carriers, hosting
            providers, IT companies, communications agencies) appointed, if necessary, as Data Processors by the Owner.
            The updated list of these parties may be requested from the Owner at any time.</p>

        <h3>Legal basis of processing</h3>

        <p>The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the following applies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note: Under some legislations the
                Owner may be allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to such processing (“opt-out”),
                without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases. This, however, does not
                apply, whenever the processing of Personal Data is subject to European data protection law;
            </li>
            <li>provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User and/or for any
                pre-contractual obligations thereof;
            </li>
            <li>processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is subject;</li>
            <li>processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
                official authority vested in the Owner;
            </li>
            <li>processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner or by a third
                party.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing,
            and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a
            requirement necessary to enter into a contract. </p>

        <h3>Place</h3>

        <p>The Data is processed at User's local.<br><br></p>

        <p>Therefore:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance of a contract between the Owner and the
                User shall be retained until such contract has been fully performed.
            </li>
            <li>Personal Data collected for the purposes of the Owner’s legitimate interests shall be retained as long
                as needed to fulfill such purposes. Users may find specific information regarding the legitimate
                interests pursued by the Owner within the relevant sections of this document or by contacting the Owner.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever the User has given consent to
            such processing, as long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may be obliged to retain
            Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to do so for the performance of a legal obligation or
            upon order of an authority.<br><br>
            Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right
            to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after expiration
            of the retention period.</p>

        <h2>The rights of Users</h2>

        <p>Users may exercise certain rights regarding their Data processed by the Owner.</p>

        <p>Users entitled to broader protection standards may exercise any of the rights described below. In all other
            cases, Users may inquire with the Owner to find out which rights apply to them.</p>

        <p>In particular, Users have the right to do the following:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Withdraw their consent at any time.</b> Users have the right to withdraw consent where they have
                previously given their consent to the processing of their Personal Data.
            </li>
            <li><b>Object to processing of their Data.</b> Users have the right to object to the processing of their
                Data if the processing is carried out on a legal basis other than consent. Further details are provided
                in the dedicated section below.
            </li>
            <li><b>Access their Data.</b> Users have the right to learn if Data is being processed by the Owner, obtain
                disclosure regarding certain aspects of the processing and obtain a copy of the Data undergoing
                processing.
            </li>
            <li><b>Verify and seek rectification.</b> Users have the right to verify the accuracy of their Data and ask
                for it to be updated or corrected.
            </li>
            <li><b>Restrict the processing of their Data.</b> Users have the right, under certain circumstances, to
                restrict the processing of their Data. In this case, the Owner will not process their Data for any
                purpose other than storing it.
            </li>
            <li><b>Have their Personal Data deleted or otherwise removed.</b> Users have the right, under certain
                circumstances, to obtain the erasure of their Data from the Owner.
            </li>
            <li><b>Receive their Data and have it transferred to another controller.</b> Users have the right to receive
                their Data in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format and, if technically feasible, to
                have it transmitted to another controller without any hindrance. This provision is applicable provided
                that the Data is processed by automated means and that the processing is based on the User's consent, on
                a contract which the User is part of or on pre-contractual obligations thereof.
            </li>
            <li><b>Lodge a complaint.</b> Users have the right to bring a claim before their competent data protection
                authority.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Details about the right to object to processing</h3>

        <p>Where Personal Data is processed for a public interest, in the exercise of an official authority vested in
            the Owner or for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner, Users may object to such
            processing by providing a ground related to their particular situation to justify the objection.</p>

        <p>Users must know that, however, should their Personal Data be processed for direct marketing purposes, they
            can object to that processing at any time without providing any justification. To learn, whether the Owner
            is processing Personal Data for direct marketing purposes, Users may refer to the relevant sections of this
            document. </p>

        <h3>How to exercise these rights</h3>

        <p>Any requests to exercise User rights can be directed to the Owner through the contact details provided in
            this document. These requests can be exercised free of charge and will be addressed by the Owner as early as
            possible and always within one month.</p>

        <h2>Applicability of broader protection standards</h2>

        <p>While most provisions of this document concern all Users, some provisions expressly only apply if the
            processing of Personal Data is subject to broader protection standards.</p>

        <p>Such broader protection standards apply when the processing:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>is performed by an Owner based within the EU;</li>
            <li>concerns the Personal Data of Users who are in the EU and is related to the offering of paid or unpaid
